Addon pack improves the gameplay by removing annoying HUD, death sound, explosions ringing, red death screen, and more.  
Pack is not author's, but just a combination of separate addons into one whole.  
Combined for the purpose of saving space in subscriptions and time for installation.  
Addons list includes:

-  [GodSentTools GPU Saver](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2717005362)  
Disables rendering entirely, when the game window is not focused or minimized. This helps to reduce GPU load and maybe save you from VRAM crash.  
I changed the color from blue to black. It is better for the eyes.

-  [Death Sound Remover](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=158713291)  
Tired of the annoying HEV Suit flatline that plays when you die? This replace that annoying sound with no death sound at all!

-  [Tinnitus Remover (Explosion Ring Remover)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1120187282)  
Removes the annoying ear ringing / tinnitus sound.

-  [NUC - F**k Weapon Selector sound](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2606969631)  
Removes the weapon switch and select sounds.  
I also removed the sound when selecting weapon_rpg.  
Reboot required.

-  [Muted Toolgun](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1080666656)  
Removes the laser effect from the toolgun and mutes the sound.

-  [Red Deathscreen Remover](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=864612139)  
Removes that pesky red default deathscreen.

Removes the large HEV Suit Overlay from the +zoom (default key b).

-  [Script Error icon remover](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2921264832)  
Removes the error icon of lua files, scripts, despite the fact that the addon that causes errors works fine.

- [Kill Feed Disabler](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1693883096)  
Addon will disable killfeed.

-  [Hide Server Cvar Messages](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3002102510)  
Hides all messages the game prints in chat when player changes server cvar. Means that there will be no more messages like a "Server cvar 'ai_disabled' changed to 0".

Press mouse2 to respawn where u died. Command: 'respawn_on_death' to toggle on or off.

-  [Cease Fire Script](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2906517243)  
Script that will prevent concrete, metal, plaster and rocky props from burning when damaged with explosion damage. Stuff like your wooden crates and barrels will burn as usual.

-  [Quit with Alt+F4](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=580474690)
